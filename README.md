# Mango_Leaf_Disease
The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a subtype of Neural Networks that is mainly used for 
applications in image and speech recognition. Here I implementing the Convolutional Neural Network 
using python. Here, I build an classifier for mango leaf diseases using CNN model.
